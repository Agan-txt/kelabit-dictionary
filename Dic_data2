burak até (dor) n. pre-Christian
traditional feast that was held at
the time of secondary burial of a
deceased’s bones. [Ususally, it’s
only the skull of the deceased that
was brought to the burial ground
(binatuh) some distance away
from the settlement for its final
placement. During the burak até,
the monumental task of organizing
the labour of invited guests was
undertaken by the host family
and relatives, such as building; i)
kawang, cutting a large gap in the
landscape profile along the top of a
ridge; ii) nabang, digging a ditch; iii)
perupun, compiling a large mound
of rocks on higher ground taken
from the rocky bank, and iv) nuped
batuh, the raising of megaliths.
These huge endeavours require the
invitation of a large group of people
from neighbouring villages to make
it successful. In order to feed the
‘workers’, typically sambar deers,
water buffaloes or tens of large pigs
would be slaughtered and a profuse
volume of rice beer, burak, would be
poured out to go along with it.
burak kuab also burak lua (dor) n.
dormant Kelabit practice; ritual feast
and ceremony held in pre-Christian
times in which a child or some
children would be anointed with the
blood of a pig. [On such occasions,

and various ceremonies would be
performed such as ngutek (dor), a
headhunting ritual involving enemy
skulls; nuwat anak (dor), a ritual
blessing for children; nekip and
ngefar, a ritual where both girls and
boys were clothed in their respective
traditional attires (tekip and efar).
The burak lua could last for a few
days to a week, depending upon the
resources of the host family and the
amount of rice beer prepared.]

dayung n. a medicine man, a spirit
healer, spirit medium. [Before
Christianity, a dayung would be
called upon to heal a sick person.
Sicknesses were considered to be the
result of a person’s spirit (ada’), being
ensnared or trapped by demons. It
is believed that a person’s spirit can
travel to different or distant places
without the person being aware.
Once the spirit is trapped or is misled
by the demon, it delays its entry back
into the human body thereby causing
sickness. the task of the dayung is
to search for the spirit of the sick
person and lure it back into the
victim’s physical body. (the following
was recorded by and adapted from
anthropologist Amster, M.) The
names of some of the healing spirits
(ada’ dayung) which the healer was
believed to have contacted and who
would enter the healer’s body, are:
i) Oyau Kabau, considered a very
powerful spirit; ii) Ada’ bikeh, (lit. a
mute spirit); iii) Ada’ Balang, tiger;
iv) Ada’ Pun Tumid, mountain spirit
or Upturned Heel giant); and v)
Ada’ Uyung Ba’ung. It was believed
that sickness was brought on by bad
spirits (Ada’ ngurir) who come from
four places; i) tana’ temubu’, ant
mound of red soil; ii) getemo, large
ant’s nest found on trees; iii) rupan,
salt lick and red water (fa’ sia’),
places where animals go to drink;
iv) telé, a large tree whose canopy
is believed to be the home of spirit.
ADuring the divination, the spirit
healer would not eat deer (payo),
mouse deer (tela’o), or the seasoning
ipa’ as it was believed the healing
spirits (ada’ dayung) were afraid
of these foods. The parang (karit)
played an important role in the
spirit healing ceremony being used
to ensnare (metaleb) and transfer
the spirits.] These healing traditions
are common among Indigenous
peoples of Borneo, and with specific
adaptations by different groups. (See

would fall sick or die and if a lalau
opened its mouth and the person
passing by happened to see it, the
lalau could eat their soul. Lalau

[Keeping ‘warm’ is an important
aspect of Kelabitness, meaning to
do things in company with others
or in community. Aloneness and
individuality is shunned. In the past,
when someone dies, the spirit of the
dead is considered to travel alone on a
journey to the land of the dead, which
is unbearable for the living to think
about. For this reason, the corpse of a
beloved is kept in the family house or
nearby, for a considerable amount of
time before the bones are buried in a
secure place. Each morning an ember
from the family hearth is brought to
the corpse to keep it ‘warm’]. (root
